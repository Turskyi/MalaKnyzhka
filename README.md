# –ú–∞–ª–∞ –ö–Ω–∏–∂–∫–∞ (–¢–∞—Ä–∞—Å –®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ)

Welcome to "–ú–∞–ª–∞ –ö–Ω–∏–∂–∫–∞ (–¢–∞—Ä–∞—Å –®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ)," a Compose Multiplatform project
designed to deliver a cohesive reading experience across Android, iOS, Web, and
Desktop. This project aims to celebrate the lyrical beauty of Taras Shevchenko's
poetry.

## PROJECT SPECIFICATION

‚Ä¢ Programming language: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/);

‚Ä¢
Framework: [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/);

‚Ä¢ SDK: [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html);

‚Ä¢ Interface: [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose);

‚Ä¢ Version control system: [Git](https://git-scm.com);

‚Ä¢ Git Hosting Service: [GitHub](https://github.com);

‚Ä¢ **Code Readability:** code is easily readable with no unnecessary blank
lines, no unused variables or methods, and no commented-out code, all
variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another
developer reading the code can easily understand their function.

‚Ä¢ Architectural pattern:
[Monolith](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures#all-in-one-applications);

## Project Structure

- **`/composeApp`**: Contains shared code for the Compose Multiplatform
  applications.

  - **`commonMain`**: Houses the common code for all targets.
  - **Platform-specific folders** (e.g., `iosMain`, `androidMain`): These
    contain code for specific platforms like CoreCrypto for iOS in the
    `iosMain` folder.

- **`/iosApp`**: Contains the iOS applications. Despite sharing UI code, this
  serves as the entry point for the iOS app and can include Swift/SwiftUI code
  if needed.

## About the Project

### Overview

"–ú–∞–ª–∞ –ö–Ω–∏–∂–∫–∞ (–¢–∞—Ä–∞—Å –®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ)" is a digital collection of Taras Shevchenko's
works, offering a seamless reading experience with draggable dividers and
elegant page transitions. It supports multiple platforms through Compose
Multiplatform, sharing a unified codebase.

### Features

- **Platform Support**: A single codebase approach for Android, iOS, Web, and
  Desktop.
- **Interactive UI**: Draggable dividers allowing users to switch between text
  and images effortlessly.
- **Swipe Gestures**: Smooth page transitions with horizontal drag gestures.
- **Multilingual Support**: Access Shevchenko's poetry in its native language.
- **Authentic Scans**: Includes scanned book spreads of the original "–ú–∞–ª–∞
  –ö–Ω–∏–∂–∫–∞" with the actual handwriting of Taras Shevchenko, offering a glimpse
  into the early Ukrainian language and script.
